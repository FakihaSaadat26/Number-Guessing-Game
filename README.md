# Number-Guessing-Game
🎯 Number Guessing Game (C++)
This is a simple command-line based Number Guessing Game written in C++ where:

The player defines the number range.

A random secret number is generated within that range.

The player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

The game keeps track of the best score across rounds.

🚀 Features
User-defined range and guess limit.

Input validation to prevent crashes.

Feedback after each guess: "Too high", "Too low", or "Correct".

Displays the best score (fewest attempts).

Option to replay the game after each round.

🧠 How It Works
You enter the minimum and maximum value for the secret number.

The program generates a random number in that range.

You enter how many guesses you're allowed.

You try to guess the secret number within the allowed attempts.

After each guess, the program will tell you if it's too high or too low.

If you guess correctly, it congratulates you and updates the best score if it's a new record.

After each round, you're asked if you want to play again.

📦 Requirements
C++ compiler (e.g. g++)
